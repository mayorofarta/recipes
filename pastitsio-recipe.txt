    In a saucepan, melt 4 tablespoons butter, then mix in flour and 1/4 teaspoon salt.
    Slowly stir in the 2 cups milk, stirring well after each addition so that no lumps form.
    Cook and stir on medium high until cream sauce starts to thicken; stir for one minute more, then remove from heat.
    Beat egg in a small bowl, then pour into cream sauce, stirring briskly.
    Blend in the 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese.
    Layer half the pasta mixture in a 11" x 7" (or 2 quart) baking dish.
    Spoon the meat mixture evenly on top, then the remaining pasta.
    Pour cream sauce over top, to cover completely.
    Bake, uncovered, at 350F for about 40 minutes, or until hot and lightly browned.
    Let stand for 10 minutes.
